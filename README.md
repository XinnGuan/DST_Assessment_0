##Introduction 

We explored the dataset of the Titanic passengers. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in 1502 out of 2224 passenger and crew deaths. This report aims to predict what kind of people are more likely to survive this disaster. We analyse the association between survival rates with passengers’ gender, title, class and age, in which we deal with the missing data and then use data visualisation.
