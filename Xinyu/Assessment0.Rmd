##Initial exploration







##Plot to see the passenger age distribution in three classes, and explore whether there is a association between survival passengers with their age and class.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

data%>%
    select(Pclass,Age,Survived)%>%
    drop_na(Age)%>%
    
    ggplot(aes(x=Age,
               y=Pclass,
               colour=Survived))+
    geom_point()+
    geom_smooth(method=lm)+
    labs(x="Age of the passengers",
         y="Passenger class(1st,2nd,3rd)",
         title="Relations between age and class of passengers")+
    theme_minimal()

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
