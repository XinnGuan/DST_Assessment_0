Our group of four explored the Titanic data. 

The first goal for us if to find a suitable dataset for analysing. The Titanic dataset is friendly for starters and we can learn how to deal with data at a beginning level, for example, how to clean the data and how to visualise the data.

The difficulties I ran into is to get familiar with R. This includes where to find the resourses and research skills. I got stuck with the first step, importing data. The code for import which I found on Google looked nice but it did not work. Finally I found out that I needed to double the dashes. It is so easy to solve but I just gpt stucked by it. Now I think I know where and how to search for answers with errors in R. 

Then I tried to analyse the data. First I tried to clean the data by deleting missing data. There are several ways to do it, and they apply in different situations. I chose the pairwise deletion for partly deleting the data. 

Next step is to do the data visualisation. It was fun to decide which variables to look at. And I tried to use ggplot in this dataset.

Since my groupmates are faster than me at the beginning, what I did was kind of repetative. So I primarily contribute to the introduction and conclusion to this report. I learned a lot from my groupmates about R , and I think once I get the hang of it, I will improve much faster.
