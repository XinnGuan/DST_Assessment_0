## Wrapup 

We have been able to explore data visualisations. The chanllenge has been dealing with missing data and manipulating the data. 

For creating our figure, we mainly used bar charts to see the count number and proportion of survivors in various passenger classifications.

We also did random forest using python to explore the data classification.

## Conclusions

These data are interesting for analysis and we have found many approaches to clean them, fixing or removing, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data.
